# Tutorial

The best way to learn a new library is to learn from examples, let's go through some examples and you'll learn all you want :)

This framework is based on `std::execution`, but **it's fine if you are not familiar with it, the example is easy enough to understand**.

std::execution is essentially an unified interface for schedulers and async tasks. It standardizes the interfaces so that everyone
conforming the standard can use others' work seamlessly. Check [P2300 proposal](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r10.html) and [stdexec's doc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec?tab=readme-ov-file#resources) if you want to learn more.

Note: C++26 is not finalized now. Currently we're based on the early implementation of `std::execution` - [nvidia/stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec), so you'll see `stdexec`, `exec` namespaces
instead of `std::execution` in the following examples.

## Basic case - turn your class into an actor

First let's go through a basic example - create your first actor and call it.

Nearly all of our APIs are async, so let's put everything in a coroutine, then we can easily use `co_await` to wait for the result non-blockingly.
Here we use [`std::execution::task`](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3552r3.html), which is the standard coroutine type in `std::execution`.

<!-- doc test start -->
```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include "ex_actor/api.h"

// 0. Assume you have a class, you want to turn it into an actor.
struct Counter {
  int Add(int x) { return count += x; }
  int count = 0;
};

stdexec::task<void> MainCoroutine() {
  /*
  1. First, initialize ex_actor runtime.
  */
  ex_actor::Init(/*thread_pool_size=*/1);

  /*
  2. Create an actor, returns an `ActorRef` object.
  this object can be copied and passed between actors.
  */
  ex_actor::ActorRef actor = co_await ex_actor::Spawn<Counter>();
  
  /*
  3. Everything is setup, you can call the actor's method now using `actor_ref.Send`.
  This method returns a standard `std::execution::task`, compatible with everything
  in the `std::execution` ecosystem. If you met "unsupported type" compile error: (1)
  */
  auto task = actor.Send<&Counter::Add>(1);

  /*
  3.1 For local actors, you can try `SendLocal`, which doesn't require the args to be serializable.
  */
  auto task2 = actor.SendLocal<&Counter::Add>(1);

  /*
  4. The task is lazy executed. To execute the task and wait for the result non-blockingly,
  use `co_await`. Note that the task is not copyable, so you need to use `std::move`.
  */
  auto res = co_await std::move(task);
  assert(res == 1);

  // A shorter way
  res = co_await actor.Send<&Counter::Add>(1);
  assert(res == 2);

  ex_actor::Shutdown();
}


int main() { stdexec::sync_wait(MainCoroutine()); }
```
<!-- doc test end -->

1.  This method requires your args can be serialized by reflect-cpp, because it can potentially be passed through the network in distributed mode.
    
    reflect-cpp can handle simple structs and common containers automatically, but if your type is non-trivial(e.g. has private fields),
    you may meet compile errors like "Unsupported type", please refer <https://rfl.getml.com/concepts/custom_classes>
    to add a serializer for it.
  
    **If you only run ex_actor in a single process, you can use `SendLocal()` instead, which doesn't require the args to be serializable, see below.**

## Create and call an actor inside another actor

When you want to create or call an actor inside another actor. You should make the method a coroutine.

The following example shows how to create an actor inside an actor and call it without blocking the scheduler thread.

<!-- doc test start -->
```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include "ex_actor/api.h"

class Child {
public:
  std::string Ping() {
    return "Dad, I'm here!";
  }
};

class Father {
public:
  // Actor's method can be a coroutine.
  stdexec::task<std::string> SpawnChildAndPing() {
    if (child_.IsEmpty()) {
      // this line won't block the scheduler thread
      child_ = co_await ex_actor::Spawn<Child>();
    }
    // this line won't either
    std::string child_res = co_await child_.Send<&Child::Ping>();
    co_return "Where is my child? " + child_res;
  }
private:
  // ActorRef is default-constructible, you can create an empty ActorRef and set it later.
  ex_actor::ActorRef<Child> child_;
};

stdexec::task<void> MainCoroutine() {
  // Here we have only one thread in scheduler, but it still can finish the entire work,
  // because we use coroutine, there is no blocking wait in actor's method.
  ex_actor::Init(/*thread_pool_size=*/1);

  ex_actor::ActorRef<Father> father = co_await ex_actor::Spawn<Father>();
  // When the return type of your method is a std::execution sender, we'll automatically
  // unwrap the result for you, so you don't need to `co_await` twice.
  std::string res = co_await father.Send<&Father::SpawnChildAndPing>();
  assert(res == "Where is my child? Dad, I'm here!");

  ex_actor::Shutdown();
}

int main() { stdexec::sync_wait(MainCoroutine()); }
```
<!-- doc test end -->

## Pass ActorRef between actors

ActorRef is copyable and can be passed freely between actors.

<!-- doc test start -->
```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <string>
#include "ex_actor/api.h"

class PingWorker {
 public:
  std::string Ping() { return "Hi"; }
};

class Proxy {
 public:
  explicit Proxy(ex_actor::ActorRef<PingWorker> actor_ref) : actor_ref_(actor_ref) {}

  // Actor's method can be a coroutine.
  stdexec::task<std::string> ProxyPing() {
    // This line won't block the scheduler thread.
    std::string ping_res = co_await actor_ref_.template Send<&PingWorker::Ping>();
    co_return ping_res + " from Proxy";
  }

 private:
  ex_actor::ActorRef<PingWorker> actor_ref_;
};


stdexec::task<void> MainCoroutine() {
  ex_actor::Init(/*thread_pool_size=*/1);

  ex_actor::ActorRef ping_worker = co_await ex_actor::Spawn<PingWorker>();

  // 1. create a proxy actor, who has a reference to the ping_worker actor
  ex_actor::ActorRef proxy = co_await ex_actor::Spawn<Proxy>(ping_worker);

  // 2. call through the proxy actor.
  std::string res = co_await proxy.Send<&Proxy::ProxyPing>();
  assert(res == "Hi from Proxy");

  ex_actor::Shutdown();
}

int main() { stdexec::sync_wait(MainCoroutine()); }
```
<!-- doc test end -->


## Trigger task without waiting for the result immediately

You can use [`async_scope`](https://kirkshoop.github.io/async_scope/asyncscope.html) to trigger a task without waiting for the result immediately.

<!-- doc test start -->
```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include "ex_actor/api.h"

struct Counter {
  int AddAndGet(int x) { return count += x; }
  void Add(int x) { count += x; }
  int count = 0;
};

stdexec::task<void> MainCoroutine() {
  ex_actor::Init(/*thread_pool_size=*/1);
  ex_actor::ActorRef actor = co_await ex_actor::Spawn<Counter>();
  exec::async_scope scope;

  /*
  for void tasks, use `async_scope.spawn`.
  */
  scope.spawn(actor.Send<&Counter::Add>(1));
  
  /*
  for non-void tasks, if you don't want to get the result, attach an empty `then`
  to discard the result, then use `async_scope.spawn`.
  */
  scope.spawn(actor.Send<&Counter::AddAndGet>(1) | stdexec::then([](auto) {}));

  /*
  if you care about the result, use `spawn_future` instead of `spawn` to get a future-like object.
  */
  auto future = scope.spawn_future(actor.Send<&Counter::AddAndGet>(1));
  int res = co_await std::move(future);
  assert(res == 3);
  
  // you must wait for all task done before destroying the scope,
  // or an exception will be thrown.
  co_await scope.on_empty();

  ex_actor::Shutdown();
}

int main() { stdexec::sync_wait(MainCoroutine()); }
```
<!-- doc test end -->


## Execute multiple tasks in parallel

You can execute multiple tasks in parallel using [`when_all`](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p2300r10.html#design-sender-adaptor-when_all) or [`async_scope`](https://kirkshoop.github.io/async_scope/asyncscope.html) in std::execution.

<!-- doc test start -->
```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include "ex_actor/api.h"

struct Counter {
  int AddAndGet(int x) { return count += x; }
  void Add(int x) { count += x; }
  int GetValue() const { return count; }
  int count = 0;
};

stdexec::task<void> MainCoroutine() {
  ex_actor::Init(/*thread_pool_size=*/3);

  // create multiple counters, you want to increase them in parallel
  std::vector<ex_actor::ActorRef<Counter>> counters;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    counters.push_back(co_await ex_actor::Spawn<Counter>());
  }

  /*
  1. `when_all` example, handy for small number of tasks.
  */
  auto [res1, res2, res3] = co_await stdexec::when_all(
    counters[0].Send<&Counter::AddAndGet>(1),
    counters[1].Send<&Counter::AddAndGet>(1),
    counters[2].Send<&Counter::AddAndGet>(1)
  );
  assert(res1 == 1);
  assert(res2 == 1);
  assert(res3 == 1);

  /*
  2. for large number of tasks where you need a loop, use `async_scope`.
  */
  exec::async_scope scope;

  /*
  2.1 async_scope.spawn example, which only accepts void tasks.
  */
  for (int i = 0; i < counters.size(); ++i) {
    scope.spawn(counters[i].Send<&Counter::Add>(1));
  }
  co_await scope.on_empty();
  for (int i = 0; i < counters.size(); ++i) {
    int value = co_await counters[i].Send<&Counter::GetValue>();
    assert(value == 2);
  }

  /*
  2.2 `async_scope.spawn_future` example, which returns a future-like object which you can wait for later.
  */
  using FutureType = decltype(scope.spawn_future(counters[0].Send<&Counter::AddAndGet>(1)));
  std::vector<FutureType> futures;
  for (int i = 0; i < counters.size(); ++i) {
    auto future = scope.spawn_future(counters[i].Send<&Counter::AddAndGet>(1));
    futures.push_back(std::move(future));
  }
  co_await scope.on_empty();
  for (int i = 0; i < futures.size(); ++i) {
    int value = co_await std::move(futures[i]);
    assert(value == 3);
  }

  ex_actor::Shutdown();
}

int main() { stdexec::sync_wait(MainCoroutine()); }
```
<!-- doc test end -->

## [Optional Read] Wrap the result using sender adapter

We recommend you to use coroutine to wrap the result, which is easier and more readable.

But if you insist on using sender adapter for some reason, be cautious that you'll lose the scheduler affinity `std::execution::task` provided,
the `ex::then` callback will run on the actor's thread, **do not capture local variable's reference, or `this` pointer of an actor instance in the callback**.

<!-- doc test start -->
```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include "ex_actor/api.h"

struct Counter {
  int Add(int x) { return count += x; }
  int count = 0;
};

int main() {
  ex_actor::Init(/*thread_pool_size=*/2);
  auto [actor] = stdexec::sync_wait(ex_actor::Spawn<Counter>()).value();

  // Sender adapter style
  int local_var = 1;
  auto task1 = actor.Send<&Counter::Add>(1) | stdexec::then([&local_var](int value) {
    // this line will be executed on the actor's thread.
    // local_var will have data race
    local_var++;
    return value + 1;
  });

  // data race
  local_var++;

  auto [res1] = stdexec::sync_wait(std::move(task1)).value();
  assert(res1 == 2);

  ex_actor::Shutdown();
}
```
<!-- doc test end -->

In the above example, the `ex::then` callback runs on the actor's thread. If you capture local variables in the `ex::then` callback, it will cause a data race.

A more dangerous example is capturing `this` in actor's method.

<!-- doc test start -->
```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include "ex_actor/api.h"

struct DummyActor {
  void Ping() {}
};

class Proxy {
 public:
  explicit Proxy(ex_actor::ActorRef<DummyActor> actor_ref) : actor_ref_(actor_ref) {}

  stdexec::sender auto SomeMethod() {
    // DO NOT capture `this` in the callback, it will cause data race
    return actor_ref_.template Send<&DummyActor::Ping>() | stdexec::then([this]() {
             // this line will be executed on the DummyActor's thread.
             // the next line will have data race
             actor_member_var++;
           });
  }

  void AnotherMethod() {
    // the other side of the data race
    actor_member_var++;
  }

 private:
  int actor_member_var = 0;
  ex_actor::ActorRef<DummyActor> actor_ref_;
};

stdexec::task<void> MainCoroutine() {
  ex_actor::Init(/*thread_pool_size=*/2);
  ex_actor::ActorRef dummy_actor = co_await ex_actor::Spawn<DummyActor>();

  // 2. create a proxy actor, who has a reference to the dummy actor
  ex_actor::ActorRef proxy = co_await ex_actor::Spawn<Proxy>(dummy_actor);

  // 3. call through the proxy actor
  exec::async_scope scope;
  scope.spawn(proxy.Send<&Proxy::SomeMethod>());
  scope.spawn(proxy.Send<&Proxy::AnotherMethod>());
  co_await scope.on_empty();

  ex_actor::Shutdown();
}

int main() { stdexec::sync_wait(MainCoroutine()); }
```

### Understanding the scheduler affinity of std::execution::task

To understand why the callback of ex::then runs on the target actor's thread, while in coroutine it runs on the caller's thread, you need to know the scheduler switching mechanism in `std::execution`.

In `std::execution`, scheduler's switch should be explicit - by calling `continue_on` explicitly.

An actor itself is a scheduler (not the scheduler inside the runtime which used to shceudle the actor, but **actor itself**), when you call its method, you schedule a task on it.
So all the callbacks will run on the actor's thread.

But in a coroutine, the code **looks like** they are executing in the same thread.
So in order not to confuse the user, make coroutine easy to use, `std::execution::task` has **scheduler affinity** - it will keep the scheduler the same across the entire coroutine.
In other words, after any `co_await` in the coroutine, `std::execution::task` will help you to switch back to the coroutine's scheduler.
(See [`std::execution::task`'s proposal](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3552r3.html) for more details).
